# Machine-Learning-Algorithms-Clustering
For this task I had to implement the k-means algorithm and run it on quality birth rate and life expectancy data provided to my by HyperionDev

## Project Details

### Description:
For this task I had to implement the k-means algorithm and run it on quality birth rate and life expectancy data provided to my by HyperionDev. 
There are three different datasets in csv form. One is one dataset for a set of countries in 2008, one for the same set of countries in 1953 and one that combines both years. 
I was told to write some code that could read these files and then implement the k-means algorithm. I had to enable the user decide how many clusters (k) there should be. And
the algorithm also needed to run for a user-specified number of iterations.

### Functionality:
This program's main algorithm iteration loop calculates the squared distance between each data point and the centroid to which it belongs, and sum all of these squared distances.
It also prints out this sum once on each iteration. The algorithm also calculates and displays the number of countries belonging to each cluster, the list of countries belonging 
to each cluster and the mean Life Expectancy and Birth Rate for each cluster.

### Usefulness:
This type of algorithm can be used by businesses to identify possible target group within a larger complex population.

### Contributors:
This was a solo project as a requirement for the Hyperion bootcamp. However, the mentors from Hyperion Development have reviewed and overseen all of my work
